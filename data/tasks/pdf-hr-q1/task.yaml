  I am doing some data analysis based on `hr_report.pdf`. Can you help me answer this: What is the average base salary for the Consumer Home & Office Products division at the Mexico City Manufacturing plant in MX$?
  Please place the answer in a text file called "data_analysis_answer.txt" that just contains the answer.

  Note this data has been fully anonymized including the name of the company, people, exact numbers, etc. Do not let that bias your analysis.
