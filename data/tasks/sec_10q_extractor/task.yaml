  Build a CLI tool that takes a company name and date (month and year) and extracts financial data from their SEC 10-Q filing.

  The tool should:
  1. Find the first 10-Q form filed before the given date for that company
  2. Save the filing to a file
  3. Extract these data points and output to a CSV:
     - Total revenue for the quarter
     - EPS for the quarter
     - Summary of risks

  Use the official company name as it appears in SEC filings (like "Apple Inc." or "Microsoft Corporation").

  Include a README with usage instructions.
