    # Claim Verification

    One of the key challenges with chat assistants built with LLMs is that they sometimes produce content that is inaccurate with respect to the input context, referred to as a "closed-domain hallucination". This evaluation implements a workflow aimed to rigorously verify facts, or claims, whilst not penalizing circumstances where the correct intent is to synthesize new content. Previous approaches do not consider this nuanced view of verifying text generated by LLMs, particularly in a chat context, leading to evaluations that over index on making the response strictly match the source text.

    This evaluation is based on the following two papers: [Claimify](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10855) and [VeriTrail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21786). It is not an official implementation of either and please cite the original papers if you use this evaluation in your work.

    Below is a diagram explaining how this evaluation works.

    # Claim Verification in Action

    ## Sample Scenario

    The running example simulates an interaction with a user and assistant where:

    1. User uploads a financial document and the assistant does some initial analysis
    2. User uploads another financial document and asks for a comparison written to a document.
    3. The assistant has to load in the new file and then use the edit file tool to create the document.

    In the generated document, we intentionally insert a factual inaccuracy: it incorrectly states "Xbox growth slowed to +9%" when the source document actually says "More Personal Computing growth slowed to +9%". The claim verification system detects this inaccuracy and helps correct it.

    CAPABILITY_MANIFEST = """# Overview
    This assistant can work with files available to it, create or edit documents, read file contents, and search for information using the provided tools. \
    Its capabilities are limited to what the tools explicitly support and the ability to return textual answers using Markdown syntax

    ## File Operations

    CAN
    - Use ls to list the files that you can view.
    - Use view to read the contents of a file at the specified path.
    - Use edit_file to create or edit documents.
    - Extract and summarize information from files it can read (for example, key metrics in an earnings release).

    CANNOT
    - Access or read files that are not listed by ls or otherwise not within the accessible file scope.
    - Delete, move, rename, or copy files or folders (no tool is provided for these operations).
    - Execute or run files, scripts, or programs (no execution tools are provided).
    - Guarantee readability of non-text or unsupported formats; if view cannot return readable contents (e.g., binary or protected files), the assistant cannot process them.
    - Access external storage locations (e.g., cloud drives, email attachments) unless their files are present in the accessible file list.

    ## Data Processing

    CAN
    - Read and interpret text returned by view.
    - Identify, extract, and summarize key metrics and facts present in a document (e.g., revenue, EPS, guidance) when they are explicitly stated in the text.
    - Perform straightforward comparisons and simple calculations based on the text it can read.

    CANNOT
    - Infer or fabricate data that is not present in the viewed content or user-provided context.
    - Parse or analyze content that is not retrievable as readable text via view.
    - Perform code execution, data transformation, or advanced analytics beyond text-based reasoning and summarization (no computation or execution tools are provided).

    ## Search and External Information

    CAN
    - Use search to search for information.

    CANNOT
    - Browse specific URLs, click links, or navigate web pages (no browsing or fetching tool is provided).
    - Download external files or ingest web content directly into the file workspace.
    - Access real-time or paywalled data sources beyond what search returns via its own interface.

    ## Writing and Reporting

    CAN
    - Generate textual summaries, key takeaways, and bullet lists.
    - Use edit_file to create or edit documents containing extracted metrics, summaries, notes, or reports.

    CANNOT
    - Produce or export files in formats or locations not supported by edit_file.
    - Guarantee specific document layouts or complex formatting beyond what edit_file supports.

    ## Interaction and Task Flow

    CAN
    - Ask for clarification or a file path if the target document (e.g., an earnings release) is not identifiable via ls.
    - Propose a plan: use ls to discover candidate files, view to inspect contents, then summarize key metrics, and optionally use edit_file to produce a written report.

    CANNOT
    - Proceed with file analysis if the needed file is not accessible via ls/view.
    - Confirm the existence of a file without checking via ls or receiving the exact path from the user.

    ## Constraints and Assumptions

    - Tool capabilities are limited to their explicit definitions:
        - search: Search for information
        - edit_file: Create or edit documents
        - ls: List the files that you can view
        - view: Read the contents of a file at the specified path
    - The assistant's ability to analyze any document depends on successful retrieval of readable content via view.
    - Absence of tools for deletion, movement, renaming, code execution, web browsing, downloading, or uploading implies those actions are not supported.

    ### Formatting Claim Verifier Output

    To rewrite the response, we will give gpt-5 the original "response" (in this case it was actually the document). Additionally, we will format the output from claim verification where we provide each **un-verified** sentence alongside with the verifier's justification for why it could not be verified. The following instructions will be injected as a user message as the last message of the message history, replacing the message to be rewritten.

    ```markdown
