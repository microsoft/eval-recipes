  Build a tool that uses the ddgs (Dux Distributed Global Search) Python library to find and summarize the latest news on a given topic.

  The tool should:
  1. Use ddgs to search for high quality recent news articles on the specified topic
  2. Find supporting information after the initial search returns web links.
  3. Create a summary that synthesizes the findings into a digestible report.
  4. Save the output to a markdown file
  5. Ensure all content is grounded in actual factual results from the web with proper citations (including URLs and publication dates)

  The tool should be a command-line interface that accepts a topic as input and produces a well-formatted markdown report with:
  - A summary of the latest developments on the topic with citations and references to source articles

  Make sure to include a README.md with usage instructions and examples.
