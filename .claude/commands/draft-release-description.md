Can you help me draft a release description for my current changes.

1. Look at the previous release logs at https://github.com/microsoft/eval-recipes/releases your draft release MUST follow the same style and structure.
2. Look at my currently staged changes to identify what is changing.
3. Create a draft release description based on the recent code changes and place it in `media/draft_release_{version}.md`
