  Put together our Q4 Sales Review materials for the exec meeting next week.

  An Excel workbook called "Q4_Sales_Analysis.xlsx" with:
     - A summary sheet showing total revenue by month and region
     - Pivot tables breaking down performance by product category and region
     - At least one chart visualizing the quarterly trend
     - A returns analysis section

  A PowerPoint called "Q4_Sales_Executive_Summary.pptx" that summarizes the key insights:
     - Executive summary of overall performance vs quota
     - Regional highlights (wins, challenges, notable deals)
     - Product performance breakdown
     - Key concerns (returns, churn, lost deals)
     - Recommendations for Q1

  The execs want the story, not just the numbers - so pull in the qualitative feedback from the regional teams too.
