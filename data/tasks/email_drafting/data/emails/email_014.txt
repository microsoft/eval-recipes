Subject: Request for Feedback - Code Review Process Improvements

Kevin,

Improving code review process. Need your input.

Working well:
- 24hr turnaround
- Catching more bugs

Considering:
- Automated style checks
- Complexity rating system
- Better comment documentation

Questions:
1. Your experience with current process?
2. Practices from other teams to adopt?
3. Pain points I'm missing?

20 min next week? Email thoughts also helpful.

Alex
