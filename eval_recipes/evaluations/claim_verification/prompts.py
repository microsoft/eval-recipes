SELECTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an assistant to a fact-checker. \
You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text. \
You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. \
If it contains "[...]", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. \
You will also be given a particular sentence of interest from the response. \
Your task is to determine whether this particular sentence contains at least one specific and verifiable proposition, \
and if so, to return a complete sentence that only contains verifiable information.

Note the following rules:
- If the sentence is about a lack of information, e.g., \
the dataset does not contain information about X, then it does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition.
- It does NOT matter whether the proposition is true or false.
- It does NOT matter whether the proposition is relevant to the question.
- It does NOT matter whether the proposition contains ambiguous terms, e.g., a pronoun without a clear antecedent. \
Assume that the fact-checker has the necessary information to resolve all ambiguities.
- You will NOT consider whether a sentence contains a citation when determining if it has a specific and verifiable proposition.

You must consider the preceding and following sentences when determining if the sentence has a specific and verifiable proposition. For example:
- if preceding sentence = "Who is the CEO of Company X?" and sentence = "John" then sentence contains a specific and verifiable proposition.
- if preceding sentence = "Jane Doe introduces the concept of regenerative technology" \
and sentence = "It means using technology to restore ecosystems" then sentence contains a specific and verifiable proposition.
- if preceding sentence = "Jane is the President of Company Y" and sentence = "She has increased its revenue by 20%" \
then sentence contains a specific and verifiable proposition.
- if sentence = "Guests interviewed on the podcast suggest several strategies for fostering innovation" \
and the following sentences expand on this point (e.g., give examples of specific guests and their statements), \
then sentence is an introduction and does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition.
- if sentence = "In summary, a wide range of topics, including new technologies, personal development, \
and mentorship are covered in the dataset" and the preceding sentences provide details on these topics, \
then sentence is a conclusion and does NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition.

Here are some examples of sentences that do NOT contain any specific and verifiable propositions:
- By prioritizing ethical considerations, companies can ensure that their innovations are not only groundbreaking but also socially responsible
- Technological progress should be inclusive
- Leveraging advanced technologies is essential for maximizing productivity
- Networking events can be crucial in shaping the paths of young entrepreneurs and providing them with valuable connections
- AI could lead to advancements in healthcare
- This implies that John Smith is a courageous person

Here are some examples of sentences that likely contain a specific and \
verifiable proposition and how they can be rewritten to only include verifiable information:
- The partnership between Company X and Company Y illustrates the power of innovation-> "There is a partnership between Company X and Company Y"
- Jane Doe's approach of embracing adaptability and prioritizing customer feedback can be valuable advice for new executives-> \
"Jane Doe's approach includes embracing adaptability and prioritizing customer feedback"
- Smith's advocacy for renewable energy is crucial in addressing these challenges-> "Smith advocates for renewable energy"
- **John Smith**: instrumental in numerous renewable energy initiatives, playing a pivotal role in Project Green-> \
"John Smith participated in renewable energy initiatives, playing a role in Project Green"
- The technology is discussed for its potential to help fight climate change-> \
remains unchanged- John, the CEO of Company X, is a notable example of effective leadership-> \
"John is the CEO of Company X"- Jane emphasizes the importance of collaboration and perseverance-> remains unchanged
- The Behind the Tech podcast by Kevin Scott is an insightful podcast that explores the themes of innovation and technology-> \
"The Behind the Tech podcast by Kevin Scott is a podcast that explores the themes of innovation and technology"
- Some economists anticipate the new regulation will immediately double production costs, while others predict a gradual increase-> remains unchanged
- AI is frequently discussed in the context of its limitations in ethics and privacy-> "AI is discussed in the context of its limitations in ethics and privacy"
- The power of branding is highlighted in discussions featuring John Smith and Jane Doe-> remains unchanged
- Therefore, leveraging industry events, as demonstrated by Jane's experience at the Tech Networking Club, can provide visibility and traction for new ventures-> \
"Jane had an experience at the Tech Networking Club, and her experience involved leveraging an industry event to provide visibility and traction for a new venture"

Your output must adhere to the following format exactly. Only replace what's inside the <insert> tags; do NOT remove the step headers.
Sentence:
<insert>

4-step stream of consciousness thought process \
(1. reflect on criteria at a high-level-> \
2. provide an objective description of the excerpt, the sentence, and its surrounding sentences-> \
3. consider all possible perspectives on whether the sentence explicitly or implicitly contains a specific and verifiable proposition, \
or if it just contains an introduction for the following sentence(s), a conclusion for the preceding sentence(s), \
broad or generic statements, opinions, interpretations, speculations, statements about a lack of information, etc.-> \
4. only if it contains a specific and verifiable proposition: \
reflect on whether any changes are needed to ensure that the entire sentence only contains verifiable information):

DISAMBIGUATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an assistant to a fact-checker. You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text (it may be referred to by other names, e.g., a dataset). \
You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains "[...]", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. \
The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as "the context". Your task is to "decontextualize" the sentence, which means:
1. determine whether it's possible to resolve partial names and undefined acronyms/abbreviations in the sentence using the question and the context; if it is possible, you will make the necessary changes to the sentence
2. determine whether the sentence in isolation contains linguistic ambiguity that has a clear resolution using the question and the context; if it does, you will make the necessary changes to the sentence

Note the following rules:
- "Linguistic ambiguity" refers to the presence of multiple possible meanings in a sentence. Vagueness and generality are NOT linguistic ambiguity. Linguistic ambiguity includes referential and structural ambiguity. Temporal ambiguity is a type of referential ambiguity.
- If it is unclear whether the sentence is directly answering the question, you should NOT count this as linguistic ambiguity. You should NOT add any information to the sentence that assumes a connection to the question.
- If a name is only partially given in the sentence, but the full name is provided in the question or the context, the DecontextualizedSentence must always use the full name. The same rule applies to definitions for acronyms and abbreviations. However, the lack of a full name or a definition for an acronym/abbreviation in the question and the context does NOT count as linguistic ambiguity; in this case, you will just leave the name, acronym, or abbreviation as is.
- Do NOT include any citations in the DecontextualizedSentence.
- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence.

Here are some correct examples that you should pay attention to:
1. Question = "Describe the history of TurboCorp", Context = "John Smith was an early employee who transitioned to management in 2010", Sentence = "At the time, he led the company's operations and finance teams."
    - For referential ambiguity, "At the time", "he", and "the company's" are unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: "At the time" corresponds to 2010, "he" refers to John Smith, and "the company's" refers to TurboCorp.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: In 2010, John Smith led TurboCorp's operations and finance teams.
2. Question = "Who are notable executive figures?", Context = "[...]**Jane Doe**", Sentence = "These notes indicate that her leadership at TurboCorp and MiniMax is accelerating progress in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture."
    - For referential ambiguity, "these notes" and "her" are unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of "these notes", since there is no indication in the question or context. However, they would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation of "her": Jane Doe.
    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) Jane's leadership is accelerating progress in renewable energy and sustainable agriculture at both TurboCorp and MiniMax, (2) Jane's leadership is accelerating progress in renewable energy at TurboCorp and in sustainable agriculture at MiniMax. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized
3. Question = "Who founded MiniMax?", Context = "None", Sentence = "Executives like John Smith were involved in the early days of MiniMax."
    - For referential ambiguity, "like John Smith" is unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: John Smith is an example of an executive who was involved in the early days of MiniMax.
    - Note that "Involved in" and "the early days" are vague, but they are NOT linguistic ambiguity.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: John Smith is an example of an executive who was involved in the early days of MiniMax.
4. Question = "What advice is given to young entrepreneurs?", Context = "# Ethical Considerations", Sentence = "Sustainable manufacturing, as emphasized by John Smith and Jane Doe, is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success."
    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) John Smith and Jane Doe emphasized that sustainable manufacturing is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success, (2) John Smith and Jane Doe emphasized sustainable manufacturing while the claim that sustainable manufacturing is critical for customer buy-in and long-term success is attributable to the writer, not to John Smith and Jane Doe. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized
5. Question = "What are common strategies for building successful teams?", Context = "One of the most common strategies is creating a diverse team.", Sentence = "Last winter, John Smith highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations, which can drive advancements by integrating diverse perspectives from fields such as artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and statistical machine learning."
    - For referential ambiguity, "Last winter" is unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity, since there is no indication of the time period in the question or context.
    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) John Smith highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations and that they can drive advancements by integrating diverse perspectives from some example fields, (2) John Smith only highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations while the claim that they can drive advancements by integrating diverse perspectives from some example fields is attributable to the writer, not to John Smith. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of this ambiguity.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized
6. Question = "What opinions are provided on disruptive technologies?", Context = "[...]However, there is a divergence in how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks.", Sentence = "These differences are illustrated by the discussion on healthcare: some stress AI's benefits, while others highlight its risks, such as privacy and data security."
    - For referential ambiguity, "These differences" is unclear. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: the differences are with respect to how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks.
    - For structural ambiguity, the sentence could be interpreted as: (1) privacy and data security are examples of risks, (2) privacy and data security are examples of both benefits and risks. A group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus about the correct interpretation: privacy and data security are examples of risks.
    - Note that "Some" and "others" are vague, but they are not linguistic ambiguity.
    - DecontextualizedSentence: The differences in how to weigh short-term benefits against long-term risks are illustrated by the discussion on healthcare. Some experts stress AI's benefits with respect to healthcare. Other experts highlight AI's risks with respect to healthcare, such as privacy and data security.

First, print "Incomplete Names, Acronyms, Abbreviations:" followed by your step-by-step reasoning for determining whether the Sentence contains any partial names and undefined acronyms/abbreviations. \
If the full names and definitions are provided in the question or context, the Sentence will be updated accordingly; otherwise, they will be left as is and they will NOT count as linguistic ambiguity. \
Next, print "Linguistic Ambiguity in '<insert the sentence>':" followed by your step-by-step reasoning for checking (1) referential and (2) structural ambiguity \
(and note that 1. referential ambiguity is NOT equivalent to vague or general language and it includes temporal ambiguity, and \
2. structural reasoning must follow "The sentence could be interpreted as: <insert one or multiple interpretations>"), \
then considering whether a group of readers shown the question and the context would likely reach consensus or fail to reach consensus about the correct interpretation of the linguistic ambiguity. \
If they would likely fail to reach consensus, print "DecontextualizedSentence: Cannot be decontextualized"; otherwise, first print "Changes Needed to Decontextualize the Sentence:" \
followed by a list of all changes needed to ensure the Sentence is fully decontextualized (e.g., replace "executives like John Smith" with "John Smith is an example of an executive who") \
and includes all full names and definitions for acronyms/abbreviations (only if they were provided in the question and the context), \
then print "DecontextualizedSentence:" followed by the final sentence (or collection of sentences) that implements all changes."""

DECOMPOSITION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an assistant for a group of fact-checkers. \
You will be given a question, which was asked about a source text (it may be referred to by other names, e.g., a dataset). \
You will also be given an excerpt from a response to the question. If it contains "[...]", this means that you are NOT seeing all sentences in the response. \
You will also be given a particular sentence from the response. The text before and after this sentence will be referred to as "the context".

Your task is to identify all specific and verifiable propositions in the sentence and ensure that each proposition is decontextualized. \
A proposition is "decontextualized" if (1) it is fully self-contained, meaning it can be understood in isolation (i.e., without the question, the context, and the other propositions), \
AND (2) its meaning in isolation matches its meaning when interpreted alongside the question, the context, and the other propositions. \
The propositions should also be the simplest possible discrete units of information.

Note the following rules:
- Here are some examples of sentences that do NOT contain a specific and verifiable proposition:
    - By prioritizing ethical considerations, companies can ensure that their innovations are not only groundbreaking but also socially responsible
    - Technological progress should be inclusive
    - Leveraging advanced technologies is essential for maximizing productivity
    - Networking events can be crucial in shaping the paths of young entrepreneurs and providing them with valuable connections
    - AI could lead to advancements in healthcare
- Sometimes a specific and verifiable proposition is buried in a sentence that is mostly generic or unverifiable. For example, "John's notable research on neural networks demonstrates the power of innovation" contains the specific and verifiable proposition "John has research on neural networks". Another example is "TurboCorp exemplifies the positive effects that prioritizing ethical considerations over profit can have on innovation" where the specific and verifiable proposition is "TurboCorp prioritizes ethical considerations over profit".
- If the sentence indicates that a specific entity said or did something, it is critical that you retain this context when creating the propositions. For example, if the sentence is "John highlights the importance of transparent communication, such as in Project Alpha, which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year", the propositions would be ["John highlights the importance of transparent communication", "John highlights Project Alpha as an example of the importance of transparent communication",
"Project Alpha aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year"]. The propositions "transparent communication is important" and "Project Alpha is an example of the importance of transparent communication" would be incorrect since they omit the context that these are things John highlights. However, the last part of the sentence, "which aims to double customer satisfaction by the end of the year", is not likely a statement made by John, so it can be its own proposition. Note that if the sentence was something like "John's career underscores the importance of transparent communication", it's NOT about what John says or does but rather about how John's career can be interpreted, which is NOT a specific and verifiable proposition.
- If the context contains "[...]", we cannot see all preceding statements, so we do NOT know for sure whether the sentence is directly answering the question. It might be background information for some statements we can't see. Therefore, you should only assume the sentence is directly answering the question if this is strongly implied.
- Do NOT include any citations in the propositions.
- Do NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the question, context, and sentence.

Here are some correct examples that you must pay attention to:
1. Question = "Describe the history of TurboCorp", Context = "John Smith was an early employee who transitioned to management in 2010", Sentence = "At the time, John Smith, led the company's operations and finance teams"

VERDICT_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an extremely smart, thorough, and meticulous assistant.
You are provided with context and a claim. \
Your task is to carefully read the context and determine whether the claim is fully supported by the context or not fully supported by the context. \
You must then provide a proof of your reasoning and cite **all** of the relevant sections in the context that supports your conclusion.
The context is specially formatted to allow you to pinpoint the exact parts of the context that are relevant. \
Each piece of context is wrapped in XML tags with a unique identifier, like <source id="1">...</source> \
and each part of the content has a line number at the start of each line like 1→. \
In order to make sure you capture the content correctly, select an extra line before and after the relevant part of the context. \
Remember that the end_range is **exclusive**, so sure to set it to the line number of the last line you want to include, plus one.
As a final step, if the claim is not fully supported, you must evaluate whether this claim actually requires verification. \
You should always provide an open_domain_justification if the claim has no citations.
This is to prevent penalizing text that is meant to synthesize new knowledge, provide new insights, generate new code to solve a problem, or to provide creative or subjective content. \
Thus, it is critical to consider the user's ask and intent when making this determination. \
Consider this provided criteria for deciding when a claim is actually "open-domain" and should not be treated as un-verified:
- Novel content (code generation, or engineering plans).
- Creative tasks (creative writing, hypothetical examples)
- Subjective opinions, preferences, or interpretations.
- Future predictions or speculative statements.
- Definitional explanations of concepts or terminology that are not expected to be present in the context.
- Original analysis or synthesis by the assistant.
- Is the claim obvious or common knowledge based on the context? We don't want to be pedantic about verifying claims that are obvious.
If the claim appears to be in one of these categories, explain why the claim might be appropriately unverified content rather than a factual error, \
then mark it as `is_open_domain=true` after your justification.

In order for the context to justify the entire claim, it must STRONGLY imply that the entire claim is true. \
This means that a careful reader of the context would naturally infer the entire claim without needing to make any assumptions or access any external information. \
Note that strong implication is a weaker standard than explicit statement. \
Also note that WEAK implication is NOT sufficient. \
For example, if the claim is "John highlights the importance of collaboration in driving innovation" \
and the only relevant evidence in the context is that John worked on several team projects, the context would NOT justify the entire claim.

There are 4 possible cases where the context does NOT justify the entire claim:
1. The context contradicts at least one part of the claim
2. The context strongly implies that at least one part of the claim is false
3. At least one part of the claim is only weakly implied by the context
4. At least one part of the claim is not addressed by the context

Note the following rules for claim verification::
- The claim is extracted from an answer to a question about a collection of documents. \
Therefore, if the claim is something like "X is mentioned" or "X is discussed," it should be interpreted as a statement about what is mentioned or discussed in the documents.
- If the claim is something like "John found X", "John reported X", "John emphasizes X", etc. (where John can be replaced with any entity or entities), \
it should be interpreted as a statement about what John says or does. \
For example, if the claim is "John highlights that transparent communication is a critical part of Project Alpha", \
and the context indicates that transparent communication is a critical part of Project Alpha, \
but they are missing the critical context that this is something John highlights, then they would NOT justify the entire claim. Let's call this the Statements and Actions Rule.
- You will NOT use any external knowledge beyond what is stated in the provided context.
- You will put yourself in the shoes of a careful reader who interprets the text holistically, considering both explicit statements and implied meaning. \
For example, if the claim is "John emphasizes the importance of mentorship programs", \
and John never explicitly says in the text that mentorship programs are important \
but it's clear that he values them because he speaks of his attempts to establish mentorship programs and he comes across as passionate about them, \
then a careful reader would find that the context justifies the entire claim.
- You will operate under the assumption that the context contains all information required to make a determination. \
For example, if the claim is "John led three teams" and the context is from an interview where John only mentions one team that he led, \
you will NOT argue that the context does not provide a comprehensive list of all teams that John led so a determination cannot be made.\
Instead, you will consider the context to be the only source of truth and since it only supports the conclusion that John led one team, the context does NOT justify the entire claim. \
Similarly, if one source in the context provides a list of teams and another source indicates that some teams were led by John, it IS valid to cross-reference the lists to determine the number of teams John led.

Note the following examples where you should mark a claim as open-domain after verification:
---
Context: Contains raw trend data (that should be cited and verified)
User Ask: "What are the implications of these trends?"
Claim: "Based on these patterns, companies should prioritize data governance frameworks"
Your Analysis: This is the assistant's original synthesis/recommendation based on data, not a claim that this recommendation exists in the context so verification is not necessary. is_open_domain=true
---
Context: Contains general documentation about Redis documentation and their current system.
User Ask: "How can I add to my program a distributed caching system with Redis that handles failover and data consistency?"
Claim: The hash ring construction process creates 160 virtual nodes for each physical Redis node to ensure better key distribution.
Verification Analysis: This claim represents novel code generation - the assistant is creating a comprehensive distributed caching implementation \
and is demonstrating how to build something new using the concepts mentioned in the context. is_open_domain=true
---
Context: Safety documentation about a laser cutter
User ask: Does the thing I am laser cutting have to be perfectly flat?
Claim: Warping of material being laser cut can possibly cause a collision with the toolhead.
Verification Analysis: While the documentation does not specifically mention warping, \
it does discuss flatness as important and it is common knowledge for this type of machine that warping can cause issues. is_open_domain=true"""

VERDICT_GENERATION_USER_PROMPT = """Context:
{{context}}

User ask: {{user_ask}}

Claim: {{claim}}

Based on the context provided, is the above claim fully supported or not fully supported?
Start by writing your justification, or proof, for why that is. \
If it is supported, then you must write down **all** of the citations that prove that it is supported. \
If it is not supported, do not write down any citations. \
At any point if you change your mind you can set the start_range equal to the end_range which will invalidate that citation.
Finally, provide `open_domain_justification`, against the criteria and considering the user's intent, if the claim is not supported with any citations \
and set the `is_open_domain` flag to true if the claim is open-domain, false otherwise."""
