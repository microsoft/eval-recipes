  I am doing some data analysis based on `hr_report.pdf`. Can you help me answer this: How many employees have a level of M1 (manager) at the entire company?
  Please place the answer in a text file called "data_analysis_answer.txt" that just contains the answer.

  Note this data has been fully anonymized including the name of the company, people, exact numbers, etc. Do not let that bias your analysis.
