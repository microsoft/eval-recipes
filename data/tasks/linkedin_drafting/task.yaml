  I need help creating a tool for drafting my LinkedIn posts. My writing process has several stages and I'd like to automate it.

  Here's how I typically write:
  - Start by figuring out what's important and pick topics to cover
  - Find a metaphor or story that makes technical concepts accessible
  - Draft explanations for any jargon I need to use
  - Write some rough creative paragraphs
  - Come up with image prompts for visuals
  - Do research to find references and incorporate them
  - Clean up the draft to match my previous writing style
  - Generate images
  - Check the logic and reasoning
  - Review and edit
  - Create a shorter version for social media if needed

  I have a folder with my past LinkedIn posts that the tool should analyze to learn my style and tone.

  The tool should output the finished post formatted for LinkedIn, any generated images, and optionally a shortened social media version. Look at other tools for inspiration if needed.
