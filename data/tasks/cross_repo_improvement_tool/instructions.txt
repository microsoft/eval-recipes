I would like a new tool that uses repomix (`npx repomix@latest`, check it out) to roll up a "source" local or remote repo and also a
"target" repo and any additional requests I want to pass along with the input. The tool should then take all that and deeply analyze the relevant parts of both
repos, consider how the requested aspects from the source would benefit the target, and produce a packet that includes:
 
- An overall, comprehensive analysis, through the lens of the ask, covering high-level to a breakdown of individual opportunities to consider, their
value/rationale, etc.
- For each opportunity, provide separate detailed broken down proposals for focused improvement candidates within the target, including full context &
implementation guidance to hand off to a team that doesn't have the full context or even access to the source repo.
 
The tool should have strong internal feedback loops where it performs isolated work to review/analyze content, draft content, review content through different
lenses (each their own isolated processes), always passing built up feedback and prior iterations back to the _analysis_ stages (so that it can be performed again
w/ the new feedback in mind) and back through the reviews until content fully passes all reviews.  The final reviewer for all content should always be a human
reviewer, to give them the opportunity to comment on things they want further clarified and explored, then back to analysis with this in mind, all the way through
all review loops again until ready for human review again.  Name the output dir and files based upon the context of the input/ask.
 
For internal reviews, consider one that ensures the analysis is grounded to the source and target repo roll-ups and the input ask - and it can also review drafts
against the analysis as well, in the same way.  Another can analyze and review how well the draft and suggestions fit within the philosophies and patterns within
the target, to ensure we're adapting properly.  Consider what other reviewers would also make sense and add them as well.
