Subject: Re: API Integration - Additional Requirements

Sarah,

Reviewed new specs. Two clarifying questions:

1. Rate limiting (p.7): Client-side throttling or API-side? Affects architecture.
2. Auth flow: Differs from kickoff discussion. Need alignment.

Call helpful? Available Thurs PM or Fri AM. Happy to continue via email.
