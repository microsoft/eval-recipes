First, extract the knack.zip file to the knack/ directory:
unzip knack.zip -d knack

I'm working on cleaning up the knack framework docs, could you find me all discrepancies in the documentation versus what is actually implemented/how it works?
Please place your findings in DISCREPANCIES.md so I can review them.
