Before we get started on our work, perform all actions below to help give you context about the project. 
Instructions assume you are in the repo root directory.

READ:
`README.md`
`docs/LOW_LEVEL_API.md`

RUN:
- list files to get a sense of the project structure
  - Unless the user asks, ignore the `data` and `demos` dirs as they have a lot of context
- list all of the files under ai_context, including from subdirectories, which contains documentation for common tooling and libraries. Remember that these files are available for when you need to use the corresponding library or tool.
- `make check` and fix any issues. Do not run any other checks, `make check` handles linting, formatting, type checks, etc
