Look at the currently staged files and check for and fix any issues around the following:
- Spelling, grammar, and formatting
- Make sure that imports in any pyproject.toml files are organized alphabetically.
- Make sure any comments in code are necessary. A necessary comment captures intent that cannot be encoded in names, types, or structure. 
Comments should be reserved comments for the "why", only used to record rationale, trade-offs, links to specs/papers, or non-obvious domain insightsâ€”things not obvious from the code itself. They should add signal that code can't.
