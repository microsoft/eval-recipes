  Build a tool that can extract documentation from any GitHub repository.

  The tool should:
  1. Take a GitHub repo URL as input including ones of the format that take in a specific branch or commit
  2. Find and intelligently extract only documentation files (.md, .mdx, .rst, and similar files) that would be most useful for understanding the repo and knowing how to use it?
  3. Also grab README files and llms.txt if present
  4. Keep the same directory structure as the original repo
  5. Convert any non-markdown documentation formats (like .rst files) to markdown
  6. Skip any images - just text documentation

  The output should be saved to a local directory that preserves the original repo structure so it's easy to understand where each doc came from.
