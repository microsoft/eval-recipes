Subject: Clarification on Yesterday's Implementation Discussion

Marcus,

Timeline correction from yesterday's call:

Next Friday: CSV export only
Multi-format (CSV/JSON/XML): +1 week beyond that

My mistake on clarity. If multi-format critical for launch, we can:
- Prioritize
- Add resources
- Accelerate

Call to discuss options?

Apologies for confusion.

Alex
