    "One of the key challenges with chat assistants built with LLMs is that they sometimes produce content that is inaccurate with respect to the input context, referred to as a \"closed-domain hallucination\". This evaluation implements a workflow aimed to rigorously verify facts, or claims, whilst not penalizing circumstances where the correct intent is to synthesize new content. Previous approaches do not consider this nuanced view of verifying text generated by LLMs, particularly in a chat context, leading to evaluations that over index on making the response strictly match the source text.\n",
