Subject: Need to discuss - API integration timeline

Context:
- API integration module was due April 15 (from Q2 agreement)
- We hit unexpected issues with the rate limiting implementation
- Auth flow changes Sarah mentioned are taking longer than expected
- Now looking at April 22 delivery instead

Key points to cover:
- Delay notification - April 22 instead of April 15
- Two reasons: rate limiting complexity + auth flow adjustments
- No impact to dashboard redesign (May 1) or performance report (May 20)
- We've added extra testing to ensure quality
- Want to schedule 30 min call this week to walk through what we've built so far
- Can provide preview access to staging environment if helpful

Tone: Professional but transparent about the issue. Sarah values honesty.

Questions for her:
- Does April 22 timeline work for her team?
- Would preview access be useful?
- Preferred time for walkthrough call?
