We're prepping for our Series A fundraise and I need your help putting together investor materials.

Can you create TWO documents for me?

1. "Investor_Pitch.pptx" - A proper pitch deck with:
   - Title slide with company name and tagline
   - Problem/Opportunity
   - Our Solution
   - Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)
   - Business Model & Traction
   - Competitive Landscape
   - Team
   - Financial Projections & Ask
   - Contact info

2. "One_Page_Summary.docx" - A concise one-pager that investors can quickly scan, covering:
   - Company overview (2-3 sentences)
   - Key metrics/traction
   - Market opportunity
   - What we're raising and use of funds
   - Team highlights
