  First, extract the graspologic.zipfile to the graspologic/ directory:
  unzip graspologic.zip -d graspologic

  I'm working on cleaning up the graspologic tutorials, could you find me all discrepancies in the documentation versus what is actually implemented/how it works?
  Please place your findings in DISCREPANCIES.md so I can review them.
