Subject: Phoenix Project - Critical Path Analysis for Q2

Rachel,

Concerns about June 30 deadline.

Status:
- 68% complete
- QA needs 3 weeks (budgeted 4)
- 2 external dependencies pending
- 11 weeks left

Risks:
- Security review: 2-3 weeks historical vs 1 week budgeted
- June holidays: -20% dev hours
- Legacy integration: more complex than estimated

Recommendations:
1. Defer advanced reporting to Q3
2. Add 1 QA resource for final month
3. VP-level escalation on dependencies

30 min this week? Have Gantt chart + risk matrix.

Surfacing now while we have options.

Alex
