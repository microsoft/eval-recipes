Before we get started on our work, perform all actions below to help give you context about the project. 
Instructions assume you are in the repo root directory.

READ:
`README.md`
`docs/LOW_LEVEL_API.md`

RUN:
- list files to get a sense of the project structure
  - Unless the user asks, ignore the `data` and `demos` dirs as they have a lot of context
- `make check` and fix any issues
